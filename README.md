## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Does this work in MSFS 2020?**  
A: No it is for MSFS 2024 only. I do not intend to make an MSFS 2020 version since I've stopped using it. 

**Q: Can I share this scenery with my friends?**  
A: No. Redistribution in any form is not allowed. Please direct others to this GitHub page to download the official version.  

**Q: Can I use screenshots or videos from this scenery on social media?**  
A: Yes ‚Äî as long as it‚Äôs for hobbyist, non-commercial use (e.g. sharing on forums, Discord, YouTube without monetization).  

**Q: I make aircraft or liveries for sale. Can I use this scenery to take promotional screenshots?**  
A: Only if you arrange a commercial license. Please contact theflaknine@gmail.com to do this.  

**Q: How do I get updates?**  
A: Check the [Releases page](../../releases) for the latest version.  

**Q: Why is this on GitHub instead of the usual popular MSFS add-on sharing sites?**  
A: I want to remain in full control of the Terms of Use and Licensing of this add-on, so I prefer to host it here.

**Q: Can I use this scenery as a real airport?**  
A: This is just a dummy airport to provide parking spots for the studio, it isn't intended to be operational. Technically, it's got a tiny runway, so you can try if you really want üòÖ!

**Q: Can you add some light / white background studios?**  
A: This is next on my list - watch for updates here!
